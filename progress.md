Have refactored some of the code, putting all methods and code relevant to the PhisonDevice 
struct in its own file calle device.go and have been reading some more file descriptors. 
I do not if I have to shorten the pins on the device again to ensure it is working again, 
as at the moment i can not get into the read and write mode. The file descriptor 
I get returned is '3'. 

The aim for the moment is to get the method GetInfo() to work and before that open the device for 
read and write operations.
